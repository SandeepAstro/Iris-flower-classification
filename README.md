# Iris-flower-classification

A data scientist pipeline was carried out, involving an exploratory data analysis, preprocessing of data, and the application of several different models was applied on the Iris dataset to identify different species of Iris flowers given just 4 features: their sepal and petal lengths and widths.

We see that we are given 3 species of iris flowers, with 50 examples for each: setosa, versicolor, and virginica

The features we have been given for each species include:
  Petal Length
  Petal Width
  Sepal Length
  Sepal Width

 It is developed by means of 3 differnt algorithms
  1. Decision Tree
  2. KNearestNeighbours
  3. KMeansCluster
 
 The accuracy of the trained model is 97.78% approx
